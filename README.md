# Facilities Project Cost & Lifecycle Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes facilities and project-management data to identify open project cost exposure, lifecycle delays, operational bottlenecks, and opportunities to improve project oversight.

The analysis combines Python-based data preparation with an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help business stakeholders monitor project costs, status, age, and category-level performance.

## Business Questions

The analysis was designed to answer the following questions:

* How many projects are currently open?
* What is the total estimated cost associated with open projects?
* Which project statuses account for the largest share of open costs?
* How long have projects remained open?
* Which project categories contribute the most to estimated cost?
* Where are the largest lifecycle and operational bottlenecks?

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Power BI
* Excel

## Data Preparation

The data preparation process included:

* Standardizing column names
* Converting project date fields to datetime format
* Standardizing categorical values
* Identifying and removing duplicate or merged records
* Creating project-age calculations
* Creating project-age buckets
* Identifying open and closed projects
* Validating estimated project costs
* Preparing the cleaned dataset for Power BI reporting

The original dataset contained 3,872 records. After removing 105 merged records to prevent double counting, 3,767 records remained for analysis.

## Dashboard KPIs

* **Open Projects:** 527
* **Total Open Estimated Cost:** $2.21M
* **Average Open Project Age:** 279 days
* **Assigned Project Cost:** Approximately $1.41M
* **Contracted Project Cost:** Approximately $480K

## Key Insights

### Cost concentration

A significant portion of open project cost is concentrated in the Assigned stage. This indicates that many projects have been identified and assigned but have not yet progressed to contracting or completion.

### Project aging

The average open project age is approximately 279 days, indicating potential delays within the project lifecycle and opportunities to improve follow-up and escalation processes.

### Project categories

Capital Improvement and Repair projects account for the majority of open estimated costs, making them important areas for cost monitoring and operational planning.

### Lifecycle bottlenecks

The concentration of cost in earlier project stages suggests that stakeholders could benefit from status-based alerts, aging thresholds, and regular reviews of high-cost projects.

## Business Recommendations

* Create alerts for projects that remain in the same status beyond an established threshold.
* Prioritize high-cost and long-aging projects during operational reviews.
* Track Assigned-to-Contracted conversion rates.
* Establish consistent project-status definitions and reporting standards.
* Investigate projects with missing estimated costs or incomplete lifecycle dates.
* Use project-age buckets to support escalation and resource planning.
